# DocInsight-Llama2
Efficiently summarize multiple documents using Llama2, an advanced Large Language Model by Meta AI. This project provides concise and relevant summaries, ideal for news aggregation, legal documents, academic research, business reports, e-learning, and medical records. Simplify extracting key insights from extensive texts with DocSummarizer-Llama2.

In numerous domains, a vast amount of information is accessible, posing challenges for individuals to sift through and distill pertinent insights. Parsing through lengthy documents or numerous articles is a time-intensive task. Extracting relevant data from a pool of documents demands substantial manual effort and can be quite challenging. Hence, our project, Multiple Document Summarization Using Llama 2, proposes an initiative to address these issues. We aim to summarize extensive documents or data sets efficiently, providing users with concise and relevant summaries. This approach facilitates the extraction of pertinent insights, comprehension of lengthy documents, and eliminates the need for excessive manual effort.

## Problem Statement

Unlocking the Power of LLAMA2 for Multi Document Summarization and Q&A Chatbot Integration.

## Solution

We employ Llama2 as the primary Large Language Model for our Multiple Document Summarization task. Developed by Meta AI, Llama2 is an open-source model released in 2023, proficient in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text generation, text summarization, question answering, code generation, and translation.

For Multiple Document Summarization, Llama2 extracts text from the documents and utilizes an Attention Mechanism to generate the summary. This mechanism functions by enabling the model to comprehend the context and relationships between words, akin to how the human brain prioritizes important information when reading a sentence. Essentially, the attention mechanism identifies the most crucial sentences within a text by assigning weights to each word based on its significance. Words with higher weights are deemed more important, guiding the model's focus during summary generation.
